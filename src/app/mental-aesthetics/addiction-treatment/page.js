              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-base">
                Addiction is a complex condition that affects the brain and
                behavior, causing individuals to compulsively seek out and use
                substances or engage in harmful behaviors despite negative
                consequences. It can involve anything from drugs and alcohol to
                gambling, technology, or food. Addiction often stems from
                underlying emotional pain, trauma, or stress, and overcoming it
                requires addressing both the physical dependence and the
                psychological roots of the issue.
