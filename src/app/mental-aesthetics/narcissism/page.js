      <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-base">
        Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) is characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, a constant need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. While everyone exhibits narcissistic traits from time to time, people with NPD often struggle with maintaining close relationships and have difficulty accepting criticism or showing vulnerability.
