              What is Depression?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-base">
              Depression is more than just feeling sad or down. It’s a serious
              mental health condition that affects how you think, feel, and
              function in daily life. Symptoms may include prolonged sadness,
              loss of interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating,
              and feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness. Without treatment,
              depression can affect your relationships, career, and overall
              well-being.
