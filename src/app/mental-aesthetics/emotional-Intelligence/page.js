              What is Emotional Intelligence?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-base">
              Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to recognize,
              understand, and manage your own emotions while also being able to
              empathize with and relate to the emotions of others. People with
              high emotional intelligence are better equipped to handle stress,
              resolve conflicts, and build strong, healthy relationships. EI
              consists of several key components:
