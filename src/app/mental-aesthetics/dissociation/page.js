            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-base">
              Dissociation is a mental process where a person becomes
              disconnected from their thoughts, feelings, memories, or identity.
              This can manifest as feeling detached from reality, experiencing
              gaps in memory, or feeling as though you’re observing yourself
              from outside your body. Dissociation often occurs as a coping
              mechanism in response to trauma, stress, or overwhelming emotions,
              but it can interfere with daily life and relationships if left
              untreated.
